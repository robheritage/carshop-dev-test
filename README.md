## CarShop Front-End Developer Exercise

The purpose of this exercise is for the developer to exhibit their familiarity with frontend technologies,
programming patterns and to provide a sample of what clean and reusable code means to them. Please put your comments about the decisions you have made inline, and give a summary about the architectural choices that you considered.

## Constraints

* You can use Either ES5 or ES6 standard.
* It is ok to use dependency management tools and task runners, but please make sure you include
instructions on how to run your solution.
* Please make sure the delivery package contains an unminified and human readable version of
your source code.
* Please refrain from leveraging scaffolding tools (like yeoman) or boilerplate templates.
* Please don’t use out-of-the-box plugins.
* Please create a readme file that explains what you have done.

## Exercise

We would like you to create a car search single-page-application (surprise surprise!) that lists/displays vehicles using an API. Along with listing vehicles, the search results page should allow the user to filter the results based on their preferences, how many filters you provide here is down to you, we just ask there is some form of filtering available. Clicking on a vehicle should then link to the vehicle detail page where more information about the vehicle is presented. You can adjust the UI how you see fit for the best result, but sticking to a single page application is mandatory.

## Vehicle API

In short, there isn't one! We will leave this up to you, however we are more interested in how you code the application then the API so we suggest the simplest method. At CarShop we often use [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) for simple mock API's in order to rapid prototype, we suggest doing the same for this exercise. We have provided some [sample vehicle JSON](https://github.com/robheritage/carshop-dev-test/blob/master/db.json) for you to use if you wish.

## UI/UX

At CarShop we take pride that we have created an award winning website with focus on UX. Your UI should reflect the same principles. Try creating something simple, user friendly and eye appealing. Feel free to use any UI resources you’d like to achieve that. For example you could use Twitter Bootstrap, or any other UI library. However we suggest using these as a base as we would prefer most CSS to be your own.

## Architecture

Here there is no limitation. Design your application anyway you want. Focus on clean, reusable code. Focus on frontend best practices. Show us that you know how to produce high quality modern web applications.

## Libraries/Frameworks

You can use any libraries you think are best but we would love to see your skills with React JS.

## Backend

No backend required (unless you're feeling ambitious with the API, but the role is purely front-end focused so that is all you will be judged on).

## Send us your code!

Once you have completed your code, simply send us a link to your GitHub repo or just a zip file is fine. Don't forget the readme!
